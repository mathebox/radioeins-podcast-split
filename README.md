# radioeins-podcast-split
The [Updates feed by RadioEins](https://www.radioeins.de/export/updates.xml/feed=podcast.xml) features countless interesting audio clips and can be imported into your favorite podcatcher.  
However, I'm only interested in some of the audio clips. With this project, the original feed is filtered and published as separate feeds.

## How to use
The generated feeds are published automatically on the `feeds` branch. Get the URL to the raw feed file and import it into your podcatcher.
